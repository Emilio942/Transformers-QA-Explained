# BERT Question Answering Script

![Question Answering Process](path/to/your/image.png)

This script leverages the power of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to provide answers to questions based on a given context. It's built using the `transformers` library and showcases the model's ability to understand complex queries and retrieve relevant information from a text corpus.

## Overview

The script utilizes a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for the Question Answering task (specifically `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad`). It demonstrates the process of tokenizing input text and questions, predicting answer spans within the context, and extracting the answer text.

## Features

- Utilizes the `BertTokenizer` and `BertForQuestionAnswering` from the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
- Supports questions and contexts in English.
- Efficiently finds answers in the provided context.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- PyTorch
- Transformers library
